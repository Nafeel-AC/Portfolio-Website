The ARAS device is mounted on the bike with front and rear wide‑angle cameras feeding an on‑board edge module. I helped redesign the ML pipeline for front‑collision prevention, moving from the previous model to an XGBoost‑based solution with a carefully selected feature set. This increased core safety metrics and made hazard detection more reliable without overwhelming riders with false alerts.\\n\\nOn the engineering side, I optimized the detection and classification models so they consume roughly half the compute resources on the edge hardware while keeping accuracy stable. That work included model pruning, better batching, and exporting the models to ONNX for efficient deployment. Finally, I participated in the migration from a Jetson‑based setup to a Hailo edge AI platform, validating performance and power consumption across many real‑world rides.\\n\\nThe result is an ARAS that can analyze 360° surroundings in real time, raise non‑intrusive alerts to the rider, and continuously stream anonymized safety events to the cloud for fleet analytics.
